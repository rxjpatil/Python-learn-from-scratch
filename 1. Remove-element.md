## Remove Element

### Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` to be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following things:
1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
2. Return `k`.

### Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:
```java
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
- Input: `nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]`, `val = 3`
- Output: `2, nums = [2, 2, _, _]`
- Explanation: Your function should return `k = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `2`. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

#### Example 2:
- Input: `nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2]`, `val = 2`
- Output: `5, nums = [0, 1, 4, 0, 3, _, _, _]`
- Explanation: Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` containing `0`, `1`, `4`, `0`, and `3`. Note that the five elements can be returned in any order. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

### Constraints:
- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`

### Solution

Here is the Python implementation for the problem:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        k = 0  # Pointer for the next position to place a non-val element
        for i in nums:
            if i != val:
                nums[k] = i
                k += 1
        return k
```

This code iterates through the `nums` list, copying elements that are not equal to `val` to the front of the list, and updating the `k` pointer to reflect the new length of the list without the `val` elements.

#### How It Works:
1. Initialize `k` to 0. This pointer keeps track of the position in the list where the next non-`val` element should be placed.
2. Loop through each element in `nums`.
3. If the current element is not equal to `val`, copy it to the position `k` in the list and increment `k`.
4. After the loop, `k` will be the new length of the list without the `val` elements.

This approach ensures that the function removes the elements in-place with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
